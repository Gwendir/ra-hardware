According to decent experts who have never seen or touched it: **NO**.

If you still want to get the details, proceed to the [Wiki](https://github.com/einergehtnochrein/ra-hardware/wiki).

There are three related software projects:

  * Secondary [bootloader](https://github.com/einergehtnochrein/ra-loader) for the LPC54114 to allow firmware update via Bluetooth.
  * The [firmware](https://github.com/einergehtnochrein/ra-firmware).
  * The Android app (not yet on GitHub, but coming soon. Send a PM if you need it now).
